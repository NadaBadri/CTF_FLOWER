# CTF_FLOWER

When the petals fell,
the hero took his last breath.
Nine sects were there —
but one changed something… and disappeared.

A name was broken,
a truth was twisted.
What was once clear
is now shifted and hidden.

A great warrior is dead.
Everyone knows his name.
But the real question is:
who killed him?
